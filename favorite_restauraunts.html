                <h3>4. IKEA Food & Swedish Marketplace</h3>
                <p>Hear me out, IKEA's meatballs are incredible. Their chicken tenders are incredible. Everything is incredible! It's even better after you spend hundreds of dollars on furniture. However, IKEA is located in Tempe, Arizona, so it is bit of a drive.</p>
